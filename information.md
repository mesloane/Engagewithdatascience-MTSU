### Code of Conduct

Project Jupyter is an engaged and respectful community made up of people from all over the world. Your involvement helps us to further our mission and to create an open platform that serves a broad range of communities, from research and education, to journalism, industry and beyond.

[JupyterDay Code of Conduct](../conduct/)

### Wi-Fi

For the event we will be using **UNC-Guest Wi-Fi**. UNC has a help page on [*What University Guest Wi-Fi Network Should I Use?*](https://help.unc.edu/help/what-university-guest-wi-fi-network-should-i-use/).

### Live Chat and Note Taking

We've setup a [Gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/TriangleJupyter/Lobby) for attendees to communicate with one another during the event. We've also created a [Google Doc](http://bit.ly/trianglejupyternotes) to support collaborative note taking throughout the event.

The event Code of Conduct applies to these online spaces just as it does to the venue.
